    <h2>
      Baked beans are the perfect addition to any outdoor cookout or barbecue.
      These baked beans are slow-cooked in the oven with bacon, onions, and a
      sweet, syrupy sauce, resulting in an old-fashioned taste that everyone
      will enjoy. This easy recipe has been served by my family for over 29
      years and originally came from my mother-in-law. It tastes great served
      with fresh cornbread or biscuits and honey.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups dry navy beans, soaked overnight</li>
      <li>½ pound uncooked bacon strips</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
      <li>½ cup ketchup</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons molasses</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon dry mustard</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Transfer soaked navy beans and soaking water to a saucepan; bring to a
        boil. Reduce heat and simmer until tender, approximately 1 to 2 hours.
        Drain and reserve the cooking liquid.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Arrange 1/2 of the beans in the bottom of a 2-quart casserole dish.
        Place 1/2 of the bacon strips over the beans and sprinkle 1/2 of the
        onions over top. Repeat layers once more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine ketchup, molasses, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, salt,
        pepper, and dry mustard in a large saucepan over medium heat; bring to a
        boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour sauce over the beans. Pour in just enough reserved cooking liquid
        to cover the beans. Cover the casserole dish with a lid or aluminum
        foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 1 1/2 hours. Remove the lid and continue
        to cook, checking every 1/2 hour or so and adding more cooking liquid if
        necessary to prevent the beans from getting too dry, until beans are
        tender, 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 more hours.
      </li>
    </ol>
